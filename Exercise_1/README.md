## Context

* Many knowledge bases (KB) are stored using a graph format. 
* You will require at least some basic knowledge in retrieving information from such a knowledge base via SPARQL (additionally, KB-based approaches will be used in the used QA framework). SPARQL is the common language for querying fact-based KBs.

## Learning Objectives

* Learn to write simple SPARQL queries.

## Task

Depending on your exercise variant (see Google Sheets table [“Exercise status”](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mwhJmxYYV9TdWdsoFxHXcVjaUN3n-aejQuyXkVlIzmc/edit?usp=sharing)) manually write SPARQL queries for the corresponding questions.

The variants are available in this GitHub repository. Also, in the repository, you can find the example of the question-SPARQL query pairs.

## Submission

Please, submit your results via e-mail to aleksandr.perevalov@hs-anhalt.de. Please, write QUAtsCH 20/21 Exercise 1 in the subject of your e-mail. Another way of submission is just to show your results on the exercise. If you submit your results via e-mail, please, check the submission_1.zip file in the GitHub repository as an example ("_1" postfix corresponds to the variant).

You also have an opportunity to show your results on the exercise. In this case you don't need to prepare submission file.
