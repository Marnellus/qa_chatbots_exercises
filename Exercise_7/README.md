## Context

We want our system to work in any environment: local PC, server of the University, server of the Project Sponsor etc. However, every environment has its own setup: hardware, OS, libraries and dependencies.

## Learning Objectives

* Learn how to create a `Docker` image;
* Learn how to run multiple `Docker` containers.

## Task

Work in teams:

1. Obtain an access to a server of the University;
2. Set up a repository for your solution and clone files on the server. You can use any VCS that you want;
3. Create `Dockerfile(s)` for your components as well as for the Frontend and the Backend;
4. Define `docker-compose.yml` file to run multiple containers;
5. Start your containers using `docker-compose`.

Before you start -- check the [example](https://github.com/Perevalov/qa_chatbots_exercises/tree/main/Exercise_7/qanary_example).

## Submission check

In this Exercise, **submission check will be performed in two steps**:
1. You send the code with your solution and the README with a description of files to Moodle (as usual). Then I check it, if everything is OK, we move to the second step.
2. On the Exercise, you share your screen and show how it works.

After completion of these two steps, you pass the first part.
